# Databricks - Delta Lake - Rust

This repository is purposed for various projects as it relates to my learnings and playing around with Rust. While incomplete there are likely to be several different directories of code bases for the following: 

- Hello World
    - This wil evolve over time as I follow the [rust programming book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)
- Rust API Call 
    - Polars, Delta Lake, and SQLite
- Rust with Polars and Delta Lake 
    - Locally and in ADLS Gen2
- Rust library for Python


## Running Hello World 
```
cd hello_world
rustc hello_world.rs
.\hello_world.exe
```
